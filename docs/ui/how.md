# UI Guide Overview

## Preface

This guide will  cover the basics of UI elements including how they are used, how to  change their settings, as well as frequently asked questions regarding  them. We encourage anyone having trouble with the UI to refer to this  guide for a possible solution to their problem.

### For Beginners

For players new to the game, we recommend  reviewing the table of contents to select a topic you wish to learn more  about. A search function is also available for those who know  specifically what they wish to check.

1. Enter a term to search.
2. Find a topic and review its contents.
3. Try out what you've learned!

Though repositioning and resizing elements of  the UI may seem intimidating, even minor adjustments can make all the  difference in how you experience the game. Try starting with something  small and work your way up to bigger changes.

## The Configuration Menus

### Where Customization Begins

The two primary menus used to make changes  to the UI are Character Configuration and System Configuration. They can  be accessed at any time, so don't hesitate to open them up and test out  their various settings.
